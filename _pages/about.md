Hey! I'm Maël, a french guy from Alsace. I graduated in 2019 with a Computer
Engineering degree and always have been curious about too many topics.

### Background

As an apprentice, I worked for a few years for the computer security branch
of the French Post. My tasks were fairly easy, we were recommending best
practices to internal teams that came to us with their projects. I ended up
automating several tasks that were somehow still made by hand with excel
files… Anyway, I met amazing people there, the job was for the most part
interesting but mostly quite relax.

But at that time I wanted something more challenging. That's how I got hired
by Online.net, now Scaleway, a cloud provider based in Paris and Lille, France.
That was for their very first wave of recruitement in order to scale the
company and try to become a real competitor to providers like OVH.
There, I did some DevOps stuff, that would include maintining and developping
Python API's, deploying hypervisors, virtual machines and fixing the virtual
machines images. Basically a lot of system administration and python.
Once again, I met clever and nice people from who I learnt a lot. I'm very
grateful they gave me a chance in that company.

However, I got a bit bored of the emerging management being restructured
every few weeks. I thus looked for a french program called VIE, basically
an intership abroad in a company somewhat related to France. The salary is
supposed to be good and they even provide health insurance.
That's how I stumbled upon CERN, the biggest physics laboratory in the world!
I got hired as an intern to work on the Python and Java codes of a team working
on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the big blue particle accelerator in
Geneva.

### Current Situation

As writing this, in April 2023, I've been a PhD student in Accelerator Physics
at CERN for almost two years. I somehow managed to go from Computer Engineering
to a completely unrelated PhD? Sounds cool!


### Interests and Projects

I think it would be too lengthy to describe everything here. I'll probably
write a page about that at some point.

The tl;dr though for my interests is below:

* Embedded and low level programming
* Schematics and PCB design
* Car, motorcycles and ECU tuning, along with mechanics
* Paragliding and Skydiving
* Sewing
* Climbing and alpinism
