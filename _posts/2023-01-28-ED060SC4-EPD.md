# Status of this article

This article is still being written and the project not finished. I'm taking a
head start of the writing before I get too lazy to write anything.

As of 2023-04-28, I ordered the PCB and the components. Nothing has been tested
yet so wait and see `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# Introduction

My initial project idea was to take an ESP32, a wifi-capable microcontroller,
and connect it to an E-Paper Display (EPD) and a battery in order to turn it 
into a weather display. This project is fairly simple but I discovered that
EPDs were pretty expensive! For example, a 5.83inch 648x480 EPD from Waveshare
costs about 46€. For this price, you'd get the display itself and a shield to
drive the display via SPI.

After researching a bit, I found that some people were using a display meant to
be a replacement for some ebooks by Pocketbook: the `ED060SC4`. This has a good
advantage, as the display is 6" 800x600 and costs about 25€.  
This method is though not plug-and-play, as it involves using specific
components and code. This includes generating several different voltages, 
connecting most of the 39 pins of the display and finally writing the code that
will create the correct pulses, referred to as `waveforms`.

The weather display project was then put on hold and I decided I'd make a
driver board for the `ED060SC4` that could be controlled via SPI, as if I had
bought something from Waveshare.
I've done a fair lot of C in the past and recently some Rust. As the support
for Rust on microcontrollers seems to be good and rising, I decided I would try
to write everything in Rust.

## Resources

Thankfully, I didn't have to reverse engineer the display myself as many
people already put in the hard work.  
Here's a list of the articles that helped me through this project, along
with the main reason I used them:

* [EssentialScraps](http://essentialscrap.com/eink/index.html): Apparently the first person to reverse the display, cited by everyone. Good overall description of the project.
* [Sprites Mods](http://spritesmods.com/?art=einkdisplay&page=1): Another well-cited source. Improvements on Essential Scraps' design, as some display variants required non-connected pins to actually be connected.
* [PushRAX](https://me.pushrax.com/e-ink-clock/): General hardware understanding.
* [Alex Franchuk](https://alexf.tech/blog/driving-ed060sc4lf-e-ink-screens/): General understanding.
* [EPDiy](https://hackaday.io/project/168193-epdiy-976-e-paper-controller): PCB routing.
* [PaperBack](https://hackaday.io/project/21607-paperback-a-desktop-epaper-monitor): Very impressive project and clean schematics.

# Hardware

I made a public Github repository with the KiCad files, where you can find the
schematics, PCB and components used for the board: [Github Project](https://github.com/Mael-Le-Garrec/ED060SC4-Driver-Board-Hardware/).

## Requirements

Let's start with the basics of what is needed to make this project work.


The ED060SC4 interfaces with a 39-pin connector. The [datasheet](ed060sc4-datasheet)
states the use of a JST connector `39FXL-RSM1-S-H-TB` which can not be found
anymore. Thankfully, once again, several persons found that the Hirose connector
`FH26W-39S-0.3SHW(60)` had the same pitch and could be used as a replacement.


The ED060SC4 requires no less than 6 different voltages to work: -20V, -15V,
+15V, +22V, a regular +3.3V and a display specific `VCOM` usually around -1.5V.  
Generating those voltages can be a bit tedious and finding something power
efficient even more. I found via [EPDiy][epdiy] and a [FPGA project][fpga-eink]
that the Texas Instruments IC `TPS65185` was specifically made for E-Ink
displays requiring this kind of voltages. It is a bit pricy, about 2.4€, but
at least there's no need to worry about efficiency  and schematics are widely
available.


Next is the microcontroller. The main requirement was the number of pins as I
didn't want to bother with multiplexers. I also needed a good support of Rust
along with easy to understand examples as it would be my first real embedded
project in Rust. I settled on the `STM32F103C8T6` that is widely available,
documented and an industry standard. The development board `Blue Pill` is 
fairly cheap and gave me the occasion to try the Rust toolchain with some 
examples.  
The Raspberry Pi RP2040 could also be a alternative and has the advantage of
costing only about 1€, compared to the 2€ of the STM32.


Now that everything has been roughly defined, let's jump into the details!


## Schematics

The schematics are broken into three pages to make it easier to understand:

* The board with the microcontroller and its peripherals.
* The powers rails with the `TPS65185` IC.
* The EPD `ED060SC4`.

All the schematic pages are also available [in one PDF](/assets/ED060SC4-Driver-Board-Hardware/outputs/schematics/ED060SC4_SPI_driver_board.pdf).


### Board

<img src="/assets/ED060SC4-Driver-Board-Hardware/outputs/schematics/ED060SC4_SPI_driver_board.svg" width="100%"/>

Some features of the STM32 MCU, like SPI and I²C can only be used on specific
pins. Assigning the pins can either be done with a regular picture of the
pinout or via STM32CubeMX.

<img class="align-right" src="/assets/images/ed060sc4/stm32_pinout.png" width="50%"/>
The `TPS65185` requires 2 pins for I²C and at maximum 5 other pins.
The `ED060SC4` EPD requires 8 data pins and 7 for the clock and enabling the
various registers.
The STM32 itself needs a crystal for the clock, that wil take up 2 pins.
As an interface for the user, more pins are needed: 4 for SPI, 2 for UART and
finally 2 for Serial Wire Debug to program the chip.
That is in total 32 pins. Good thing the STM32F103C8 has enough!

The choice of capacitors, crystal and `VBAT` filtering circuit of the STM32 was 
done by following [Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab/search?query=stm32) 
excellent videos on the subject. In one of his latest videos he states that no
resistor is needed for the crystal. To be safe I still added a 0Ω resistor in
case I actually need it.

I chose simple standard 2.54mm connectors for the UART, SPI and SWD. I did the
same for the `WAKEUP` and `PWRUP` pins of the `TPS65185` so I could power it
up externally without the STM32 in case something was fundamentally wrong with
my design. The first three connectors are connected to TVS diodes to protect
from electrostatic discharges (ESD).
All the power rails of the EPD are also wired to a connector so the `TPS65185`
could be used for other applications or some testing.


### Power Rails

<img src="/assets/ED060SC4-Driver-Board-Hardware/outputs/schematics/ED060SC4_SPI_driver_board-EPD Power Rails.svg" width="100%"/>

There's a lot going on in this schematic but thankfully Texas Instruments made
a great job with the [TPS65185 Datasheet][tps65185-datasheet] and its
[evaluation module][tps65185-eval-datasheet].
The schematics described in those are exactly the ones we need, as some
voltages can be choosen with different resistor values.

The IC basically uses a Boost converter and a Buck-Boost converter to generate
±16V rails. Those voltages are then lowered via two LDOs to get the ±15V rails.
Two charge pumps on the other hand can boost the ±16V to -20V and +22V. 
`VCOM` can be programatically set to output between 0V and -5.11V, and `V3P3`
to output or not the +3.3V input to save power by disconnecting the EPD.

`VCOM_CTRL` enables the VCOM amplifier when pulled high. This lets us set the
VCOM voltage before turning it on. It is not strictly required to connect it to
the MCU and can be left high with a pull-up resistor, as the datasheet states.

The `WAKEUP` and `PWRUP` pins are respectively used to turn on the programming
interface of the IC (I²C) and then the rails. The idea here is to pull high
`WAKEUP`, set the `VCOM` voltage, enable `V3P3` and then pull `PWRUP` high.

`PWRGOOD` and `INT` are used to alert if there's a fault and the rails couldn't
be powered up properly. Those could be ignored unless specific code is
implemented to recover from faults.

The schematics also include a temperature sensor in the form of a thermistor in
parallel with a resistor, as the IC can be programmed to stop operation above
a certain temperature. I will not use this feature but it doesn't hurt to add
it as the footprints and price are negligible.

The resistors `R1-R2` and `R8-R9`are used for the feedback of the charge pumps,
to generate the adequate voltage. `R6-R7` are used on the other hand to pull
high `INT` and `PWR_GOOD` that are open-drain pins.
Most capacitors are used as decoupling capacitors, the others for the charge
pumps.
The inductors `L1-L2` are used by design in the boost converters.
  

### EPD

<img src="/assets/ED060SC4-Driver-Board-Hardware/outputs/schematics/ED060SC4_SPI_driver_board-EPD ED060SC4.svg" width="100%"/>

I mainly followed [PaperBack's][paperback] and [Alex's][alexf] schematics to
wire the EPD.
However, as stated by Alex and before that SpritesMods, the pins 9 and 10 need to
be connected respectively to ground and +3.3V, even though they are marked `NC`
in the datasheet. 

I included additional capacitors for the pins that would be drawing current but
they're probably not needed and can be left unpopulated.

As many pins are linked to the same nets, the 39-pin connector now turns into
a less frightening 21 pins!

## PCB Design 

The board stackup is a standard 4-layers: signal / GND / 3.3V / signal.
An [interactive BOM](/assets/ED060SC4-Driver-Board-Hardware/outputs/html/ibom.html)
generated by KiCad is available, where every net and component can be
highlited to better understand what's going on. By default, all components are
grouped by `Value` and `LCSC Part Number`.

![Board's Front](/assets/images/ed060sc4/ED060SC4_SPI_driver_board.F.png)

There isn't much to say here, all the placement and recommendations come from
[Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab/) once again. There's always
a better way to do PCB routing, but this one should be good enough. The
subreddit [r/PrintedCircuitBoard](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrintedCircuitBoard/)
is also an impressive ressource, especially through its Wiki and the questions
people ask.

Notably though, the +3.3V pins of the various connectors have a keepout so they
don't connect to the internal +3.3V plane of the board. This is made so the
current has to flow through the ESD protection chips first. Then the current
goes into the power plane.

I tried selecting small components so the routing would be easy to do, but not
too small either so it could still be handsoldered. The smallest footprint is
0603 for capacitors, resistors and LED.
The `TPS65185` would benefit from being soldered with hot air as the pad
underneath is used to dissipate heat.
