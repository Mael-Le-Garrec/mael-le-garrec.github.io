# Status of this article

This article is still being written and the project not finished. I'm taking a
head start of the writing before I get too lazy to write anything.

As of 2023-04-28, I ordered the PCB and the components. Nothing has been tested
yet so wait and see `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# Introduction

My initial project idea was to take an ESP32, a wifi-capable microcontroller,
and connect it to an E-Paper Display (EPD) and a battery in order to turn it 
into a weather display. This project is fairly simple but I discovered that
EPDs were pretty expensive! For example, a 5.83inch 648x480 EPD from Waveshare
costs about 46€. For this price, you'd get the display itself and a shield to
drive the display via SPI.

After researching a bit, I found that some people were using a display meant to
be a replacement for some ebooks by Pocketbook: the `ED060SC4`. This has a good
advantage, as the display is 6" 800x600 and costs about 25€.  
This method is though not plug-and-play, as it involves using specific
components and code. This includes generating several different voltages, 
connecting most of the 39 pins of the display and finally writing the code that
will create the correct pulses, referred to as `waveforms`.

The weather display project was then put on hold and I decided I'd make a
driver board for the `ED060SC4` that could be controlled via SPI, as if I had
bought something from Waveshare.
I've done a fair lot of C in the past and recently some Rust. As the support
for Rust on microcontrollers seems to be good and rising, I decided I would try
to write everything in Rust.

## Resources

Thankfully, I didn't have to reverse engineer the display myself as many
people already put in the hard work.  
Here's a list of the articles that helped me through this project, along
with the main reason I used them:

* [EssentialScraps](http://essentialscrap.com/eink/index.html): Apparently the first person to reverse the display, cited by everyone. Good overall description of the project.
* [Sprites Mods](http://spritesmods.com/?art=einkdisplay&page=1): Another well-cited source. Improvements on Essential Scraps' design, as some display variants required non-connected pins to actually be connected.
* [PushRAX](https://me.pushrax.com/e-ink-clock/): General hardware understanding.
* [Alex Franchuk](https://alexf.tech/blog/driving-ed060sc4lf-e-ink-screens/): General understanding.
* [EPDiy](https://hackaday.io/project/168193-epdiy-976-e-paper-controller): PCB routing.
* [PaperBack](https://hackaday.io/project/21607-paperback-a-desktop-epaper-monitor): Very impressive project and clean schematics.
