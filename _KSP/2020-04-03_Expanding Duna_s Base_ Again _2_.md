Guess where we're going? Duna, once again!
Our mobile mobile is already quite large but another contract wants to add 10 seats, a mobile processing lab and a viewing cupola.

I took one of the designs we already made and changed the ore tank for a 4 seats module.
Nothing much had to be changed, this thing just works :)

The skycrane decided to swirl around before crashing.

We landed 9km from the Base, luckily our expand is a rover and we can make it.
Going at 30m/s (110kmph) is a little scary but the surface is pretty even.

On our way to the base we stopped to say hello to a miner landed there.
It could be nice to later move it a few kilometers so it's closer to the main base.

Approaching the base!

Aligning the rover to dock.

And finally docked!
This base can now be home for 22 kerbals, including 4 scientists in the labs.

The next steps would be to add some solar arrays with a large pack of batteries.
We don't really need that but it will look cool.
