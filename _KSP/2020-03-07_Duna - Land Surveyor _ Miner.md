This mission requires us to mine 400 ore units on Duna.
We don't require much Δv, 5500m/s should be more than enough and we have 6500m/s.

The fairing includes a probe to survey the land for landing sites, as well as the lander itself with ore tanks and a drill.

Waiting for apoapsis to circularize after having deployed the fairing.

We need a polar orbit to survey the land.
As always, Duna's moon — Ike — is in the way and will change our orbit.
This gravity assist will put is in a better polar orbit, thank you Ike!

Burning for this maneuver.

Ike encounter as planned and resulting orbit.

Surveyor probe in orbit!
This thing has a Δv of 18,000m/s, why do I keep adding xenon tanks to such probes?

Preparing for a landing on an ore-rich site.

Slowing down.

Separating the lander from the booster and extending the landing legs.

Landing burn with parachutes open.
The speed with parachutes is around 7m/s, the engine is not really necessary, the landing legs could absorb the impact.

Time to fill up those tanks :)
