The goal of the mission is to land a small probe on the surface and run science experiments.
The planet having a very dense atmosphere, a heat-shield and parachutes are needed. No retro-propulsion needed because of the thickness of said atmosphere.

Since we're not sending a pilot, but a probe, we need a relay network. Without this relay network, we would have no probe control nor could we send science data back to Kerbin.
This mission being the first to Eve, there is none. 6 RA-15 satellites will be used.
The intended orbit around Eve is ~402km with an orbital period of 42 min 23 sec.
The resonance orbit to achieve 6 insertions at this orbit is ~641km as apoapsis.

En route to Eve!

The last stage is used to have an orbit of roughly 641km - 402km

First insertion

With a Δv of 10250m/s, we have more than enough to achieve our intended circular orbit of 402km and a period of 42m23s.
Those satellites will be redesigned for the next mission, they're way too powerful.

This stage can now start to deorbit itself with the lander, that will, hopefully survive this rough landing.

Periapsis in the atmosphere, aerobraking time!

Let's hope the heatshield can take it.

It's holding!

Not burning anymore! Time to open the chutes…

![](/assets/images/KSP/imgur/MNOPFoo%20-%20First%20Eve%20Mission%21/imgur_MNOPFoo_019_OiwLCEa.png)

Drogue chutes will help slow us down before opening the main chute

Drogues fully deployed. Vertical speed around 17m/s, too fast to land

Main chute opened, vertical speed dropped to 5m/s, perfect!

Landing legs deployed

Landed, with antenna and solar panel deployed. Mission success!
Science modules have been activated on orbit, during atmospheric entry and now on the ground.

Connection to the Kerbal Space Center is done via the relay we put on orbit.

Recovering science data yields more points but we can't go back home. Instead we're sending everything we have.

The mission yielded 582 science points. Not too bad for a probe!

Our lander uses two relays to connect back to the KSC
