A contract wanted us to expand this base https://imgur . com/a/CLf2vBy
So let's do that! We only need to have like 5 more kerbals.
We'll use the same design, it has been flight proven already.

This thing looks so stupid, I love it.

We're firing the engines to slow down after having deployed the chutes.
The wheels can absorb up to a ~40m/s impact speed but we don't want to bounce and topple over.

Almost looks like a cute dinosaur. A stupid one. But cute.

Fire the engines, decouple and weeee, goodbye little crane.

We still have plenty of docking options here for future missions :)
