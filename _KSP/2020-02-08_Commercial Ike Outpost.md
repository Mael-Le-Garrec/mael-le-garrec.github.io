This mission has been accepted to earn money, because I'm broke.
The idea was to send an outpost for 5 kerbals on Ike.
As always: an antenna, solar panels and a docking port.

Mission specific: an ISRU module, hidden under the crew cabin.

Simple rocket design with enough Δv to be comfortable.

Circular orbit around Ike achieved, it's time to deploy the lander and descend.

Landing burn.
The lander ran out of fuel around 15 meters high with a velocity of 3m/s.
The lander accelerated towards the ground but the landings legs were able to take it.
