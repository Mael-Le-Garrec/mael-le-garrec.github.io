    "description": "Let's start by saying that this mission was not easy at all.\nI was in need of a challenge, by taking this mission I didn't know it would take 1 month to complete!\n\nThe objectives here are, from harder to standard:\n  - support 11 kerbal\n  - have 5,000 units of fuel\n  - have 500 units of monopropellant\n  - have a mobile processing lab\n  - have an antenna\n  - have a viewing cupola\n\nThe cost of the craft is around 310,000, which is kinda reasonable for something that ambitious.\n\nEve is a planet with a dense and large atmosphere. It starts around 100km and requires large heatshields to land without overheating and exploding.\nThe fuel required for the base is way too heavy to be launched and landed. Instead, we'll be mining resources on Eve itself. For that, we need ore tanks, drills, a converter (ISRU) and radiators to dissipate the heat.\n\nStill, this base is pretty huge and heavy. The boosters stages themselves required a fair amount of work.\n\nBeing pretty new to mining and aerobraking, those parts too took a large amount of time to engineer and test.\nDifferent journals of previous prototypes can be found here:\n  - https://imgur . com/a/yJCv8Gy\n  - https://imgur . com/a/pN44Ttm",
