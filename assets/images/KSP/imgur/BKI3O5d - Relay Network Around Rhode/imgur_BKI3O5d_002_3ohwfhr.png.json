    "description": "So, what's a geostationary orbit? It's a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of 0Â°. That probably didn't help so it's basically an orbit with a period as long as a day on the planet. Meaning it takes 1 day to do a full rotation. \nThe satellite is always staying on the same spot above the planet since the planet is also moving.\n\nWith some Wikipedia maths and python scripting, we get the geosync orbit for Rhode, about 3 993km.",
