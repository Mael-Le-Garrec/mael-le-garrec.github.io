    "description": "The circular orbit, in green, is where one satellite has already been detached.\nThe blue elliptical orbit is our resonance orbit.\n\nIt's interesting to note that the orbit here isn't 3 993km but 2 000km. There's actually a moon, Lua, orbiting Rhode at that altitude. It's nearly impossible to get the perfect orbit or period for our probes, the satellites would get captured one day or another by the moon.\nI then decided to put the relay at 2 000km. I had to redo the calculations but that's Science! If you trip and fall, just get up and try again.",
