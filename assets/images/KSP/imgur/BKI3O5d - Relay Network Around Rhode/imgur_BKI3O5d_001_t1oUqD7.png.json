    "description": "Soâ€¦ Let's start with drawings already!\n\nThis mission is a bit different from the other ones. We're not in the Kerbol system anymore! The humanity has colonized a different system, and that's where we are.\nWe depart from the Planet \"Rhode\", which is smaller and has a thinner atmosphere than Kerbin.\n\nUsually, I would get the data I need from the KSP wiki, which is incredibly useful for a ton of things. But here, this data doesn't exist, everything needs to be done manually!\n\nSo what's the plan here? Put a network of relay satellites on a geostationary orbit of Rhode. This network will enable us to launch unmaned probes in the future around the planet.",
