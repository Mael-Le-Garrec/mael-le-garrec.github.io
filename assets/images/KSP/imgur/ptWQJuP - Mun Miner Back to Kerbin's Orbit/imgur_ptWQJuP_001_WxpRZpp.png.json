    "description": "The goal is this mission is pretty simple:\n  - mine 600 ore units on the Mun \n  - put them in orbit of Kerbin\n\nTo do so, we need the usual converter (ISRU), ore tanks, radiators, batteries, solar panels, drills. \nThe Mun is rotating quite slowly: 6d, compared to roughly 3d for both Duna and Eve. Thus, fuel cells will come in handy!\nFuel cells transform a few units of fuel into electric charge. That's a good thing, what we're doing here is basically:\n  - mine ore\n  - convert ore to fuel\n  - convert fuel to electricity  \n  - repeat\n  - ???\n  - profit\n\nWhen designing such a lander it's important to remember the ore we'll mine has a mass. The first prototypes I created didn't account for that. I was then stranded on the Mun, unable to reach Kerbin's orbit anymore.\nThe Î”v map for this mission is:\n  - Mun to Kerbin Orbit (lander): 1750 m/s\n  - Kerbin to Mun: 4570 m/s\n  - Mun orbit to ground: 580 m/s\n\nThe lander thus needs to have at least 1750 m/s with _full_ ore tanks. The VAB doesn't do this kind of calculations, it's needed to do them by hand.\nThank you, https://wiki . kerbalspaceprogram . com/wiki/Cheat_sheet.",
