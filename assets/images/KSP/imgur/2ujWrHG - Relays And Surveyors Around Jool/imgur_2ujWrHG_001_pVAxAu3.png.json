    "description": "This is the first step of a rather large endeavor:\n  - Put in orbit of Jool a station with fuel capacity\n  - Land a miner on Pol, the outermost planet\n  - Have a refiller capable of making the trip from Pol to the station\n  - Optionally a craft capable of going from the station to the craft to refill\n\nIn order to do all that, we need a relay network and surveyors to analyse the ore concentration of the bodies around Jool.\n\nThe plan is to put the main craft in orbit around Jool and then deploy the 5 satellites, one for each moon (Pol, Bop, Tylo, Vall and Laythe). They wil then plan an intercept for their respective moon, circularize and put themselves in a polar orbit.\nThe ion engines have a high Iₛₚ, meaning they're really efficient. The satellites can then be rather light since we don't need to add much fuel.\nThe burn time will in return be quite long, up to 15 minutes.",
