    "description": "This contract is relatively easy but will put us to a challenge!\nWe currently have an orbital station around Duna that supports 5 kerbals.\nThe contracts wants us to expand it to 15 kerbals and 2000 units of ore.\n\nAdding 10 seats is quite easy. Adding 2000 units of ore is something else.\nWe'll be mining it from ike but it's quite heavy and will require us two trips there.\nThe refiller has enough Î”v to go from the station to Ike, refuel itself, get some ore, get back to the station and go back to Ike.",
